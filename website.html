    <div class="hobby">
        <h2>âœ¨ Filming and Editing âœ¨</h2>
        <p>My hobby is filming and editing. I regularly create and upload content on social media platforms
            like Instagram and TikTok. I enjoy coming up with ideas, recording, and editing my videos. I 
            find joy in producing short videos, whether it's a creative POV or smooth transitions, as they
            inspire others and allow me to express my creativity. I aspire to become a visual effects 
            specialist. I am passionate about creating 3D elements using green screen techniques and 
            professional software like Adobe and Blender.</p>

    <!-- Hobby 2: Doing Makeup -->
    <div class="hobby">
        <h2>âœ¨ Doing Makeup âœ¨</h2>
        <p>In the content I upload, I mainly focus on beauty, makeup transitions, and cosplay. I enjoy doing makeup to resemble the features of 
            various characters or famous celebrities, which I then showcase in my videos. I believe makeup is an art form that can inspire others 
            and boost people's confidence, especially women. I also love knowing that my skills can make my friends or clients feel more beautiful 
            for their features that i elevated with the makeup I provide. In the future, I plan to work as a makeup artist as a backup career.</p>

    <!-- Hobby 3: Acting and Singing -->
    <div class="hobby">
        <h2>âœ¨ Acting and Singing âœ¨</h2>
        <p>Before becoming a content creator, I worked as an actor in commercials and TV dramas. I enjoyed playing different challenging roles because 
            I felt that each role and story brought new values and perspectives, helping me open my mind to new ideas. Singing is another way I express
            my emotions and feelings. I hope to combine both of these hobbies and skills in activities like acting in musical dramas or theater 
            performances in the future.</p>
